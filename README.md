# Building A Static Website - Part 1: Learning Jekyll

This repository contains a working demonstration based on the [Building A Static Website - Part 1: Learning Jekyll](https://jamesmount.tech/website%20building/2023/03/18/BuildingAStaticWebsite_Part1.html) tutorial. The working demonstration can be found [here](https://jamesmount.tech/building_a_static_website_part_1/). 

Please note the following differences between the working demonstration and the steps presented:
- The configuration file includes a line specifying the `baseurl`. 
- Some of the files include the `{{ site.baseurl }}` value within some of the links.
- The repository includes a Github Action to build and deploy the webpage which is not discussed within the tutorial. 

These difference are required for deployment using Github Pages and can be ignored currently. These aspects are discussed later in the website building series.
